All users must create an account prior to using the website, failure to do so was an automatic reducing in overall grade for the original submission. User accounts are broken down to either customer or employee.

This project is intended to act as an E-Commerce and Animal Adoption site in which customers could purchase products and adopt parrots through the same website.
Employees would then be able to access inventory for all products listed on the website and perform an inventory resupply.
