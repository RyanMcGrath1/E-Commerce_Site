# Bird E-Commerce Site

This site is built using MySQL, JavaScript and PHP and offers an easy and convenient way to buy and sell birds and bird products. Users must create an account before accessing the site. After signing in you will be brought to either the customer portal or the manager portal based off the type of account created.

## Customer Portal

Customers have access to a wide range of birds and bird products, including cage accessories, bird feed, and toys. Customers can traverse the website using the navigation bar located at the top. Shopping carts can be found at the bottom of each page and will show the contents of the cart in addition to the total cost in real time.

## Manager Portal

If you create a manager account, you'll have access to a separate portal where you can view inventory. You'll be able to view detailed information about your products, including stock levels and pricing. Due to medical reasons at the time of submission much of the core functionality for this portal was not completed. The intent was to give the manager a single location to view and fill supply orders for the site.
